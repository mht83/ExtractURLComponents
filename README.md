# ExtractURLComponents

This repository contains a C++ program that extracts various components of a URL, such as the protocol, domain, port, path, query, and fragment.

## Description

The program uses a class `URL` that takes a vector of strings representing the tokens of a URL and parses them to identify different components. It also includes a tokenizer function that splits a string URL into its constituent tokens based on delimiters.

## Usage

To use this program, simply include the `URL` class in your project and call it with a vector of URL tokens.
